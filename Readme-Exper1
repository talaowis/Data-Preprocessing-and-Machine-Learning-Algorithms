This is the first experiment :

Preprocessing Steps :
1-Features Encoding
2-Missing Values -KNN Imputer
3-train/test split 0.66 -0.34
4-Feature Selection
5- OverSampling -SMOTENC



Results for :
1-Decision Tree
2-KNN
3-SVM
4-Sequential -Feed Forward -ANN

the results are in files with "ALGO"confusion_matrix.csv
,"ALGO"classreport.csv in the folder DataMining__Algorithms Results\Results\Exper1


this experiment has been done "with" scaling the xtrain,xtest sets before applying ANN.

#Data Sets after preprocessing and figures for the data preprocessing phase will be found in the folder:
DataMining__Algorithms Results\Results\Exper1\preprocessing
