# Data-Preprocessing-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This example runs different algorithms such as :

1-Decision Tree 

2-KNN

3-SVM

4-Sequential -Feed Forward -ANN

in different preprocessing steps , it aims to clarify which preprocessing steps has achieved the best precision,recall,f1-score,support.
Pay attention that we are working on a medical dataset ,where some measures are more important than other measures .


In order to run this file read HOW_TO_RUN.txt and the experiments readme files.
